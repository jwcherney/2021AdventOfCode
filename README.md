My work on the Advent of Code challenges

Please don't look at this code as an indiction of my prowess (or my weakness) as a programmer. I began this with the intent to code at the highest possible TDD standards. Then I got my first gold star, and I was hooked. Hooked bad. 

Now, I'm just trying to code these as fast as I can, with at least tests added based on the setup and examples. I've gotten slightly more sophisticated as I go from day to day, but that is purely to speed my development to get that next gold star, not to impress anyone. The amount of print statements is directly correlated to how much of a pain I found that day's challenge, and how lazy I was to not go back and remove them. 

Notes:
- I've had to search the web for help on 3 days
  - Day09: Learned what a Flood Fill algorithm is
  - Day14: Use HashMaps for keeping track of a large number of small strings
  - Day??: Can't remember, can't find it, but it also used hashmaps. I thought it was an earlier day.
